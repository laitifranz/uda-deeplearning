The method utilize two players to align distributions in an adversarial manner: domain classifier and feature generator. Source and target samples are input to the same feature generator.\n",

This means that samples far from the support do not have discriminative features because they are not clearly categorized into some classes. To identify these misclassified target samples, we utilize the disagreement of the two classifiers on the prediction for target samples. In this way the two classifiers can be treated as discriminators. The figure below can help us to understand the idea:\n",

The generator is trained to output features that simply tries to make the two distributions similar by generating target features near the support, while considering classifiers' output for target samples. In this way the generator avoids generating features outside the support of the source. To achieve this we use the term *discrepancy* $d\\left(p_1(\\mathbf{y|x_t}), p_2(\\mathbf{y|x_t})\\right)$, to measure the disagreement of the two classifiers on their predictions.\n",

The goal is to obtains features in which the support of the target is included by that of the source (*Obtained Distributions* in the figure). This allows the generator to generate discriminative features for target samples because it considers the relationship between the decision boundaries and target samples. This training is achieved in an adversarial manner.\n",

The proposed method utilizes a Local Maximum Mean Discrepancy (LMMD) loss to align the relevant subdomain distributions of domain-specific layer activations across different domains, rather than solely focusing on aligning the global source and target distributions as traditional methods do. The focus of this paper is on learning relevant subdomain adaptation through the LMMD loss, which results in improved classification accuracy on benchmark datasets.\n",

Therefore, this method is much simpler with respect to MCD-DA, nevertheless it performs slightly better. Moreover, the training of this method is fairly faster because we observed that the MCD-DA method's steps are not optimized in terms of GPU computation.\n",
