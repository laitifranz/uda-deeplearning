# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
This repository has been created for the Deep Learning project course delivered during my Master's program.

## Introduction
In this repository we deliver a notebook to build, train and evaluate two different deep learning frameworks with respect to a baseline, that involves the topic of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). For this assignment we use a UDA benchmark constisting of two domains, Product $P$ and Real World $RW$, treated as source domain and target domain, and viceversa. The aim of this project is to "propose a UDA technique to counteract the negative impact of the domain gap when training the model on the source distribution and evaluating it on the target distribution".
